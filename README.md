All sources for my BSc thesis on probabilistic preconditioning using DeepOBS.

I am working at the chair of Philipp Hennig (Methods of Machine Learning) at the University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany.

Based on these projects:

* DeepOBS by Frank Schneider and Aaron Bahde (https://github.com/abahde/DeepOBS)
* A NeurIPS paper by my supervisor Filip De Roos and our PI Philipp Hennig.
