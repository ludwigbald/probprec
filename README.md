All sources for my BSc thesis on evaluating probabilistic preconditioning using DeepOBS.

I am working at the chair of Philipp Hennig (Methods of Machine Learning) at the University of Tübingen, Germany.

Based on these projects:

* DeepOBS by Frank Schneider and Aaron Bahde (https://github.com/abahde/DeepOBS)
* A NeurIPS paper by my supervisor Filip De Roos and our PI Philipp Hennig.

## Technical description
Most of the technical parts are decribed in detail in the thesis, but here's a quick overview:

1. Experiments were run using pytorch and DeepOBS in a Singularity container on the TCML cluster
provided by the University of Tübingen.
2. The presentation is based on the fibeamer theme for the beamer class, though I modified its
source code to get rid of the included logo.
3. The thesis is based on the fithesis theme. Find out more about both here:
